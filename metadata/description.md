**Font Loader** allows you to use web fonts from a variety of services in any Koken theme. With this plugin plus a little custom CSS, publishers may change the typefaces any theme uses by default.

The plugin supports all the major subscription-based web font publishing services including [Typekit](http://typekit.com/), [Fonts.com](http://fonts.com/) and [Fontdeck](http://fontdeck.com/) plus the free [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts) directory.
