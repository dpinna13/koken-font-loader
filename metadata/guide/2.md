Title: Typekit

## Typekit

[Typekit](http://typekit.com/) requires a "Typekit Kit ID". To retrieve a kit's ID, publish fonts to your domain as you normally would per their instructions. Launch the Kit Editor window, then click the "Embed Code" link at top right. A modal will appear containing JavaScript code (which you won't need) plus your kit's ID, as highlighted in the screenshot below. Copy/paste this ID into the "Typekit" field in the Font Loader plugin settings. When finished click the **Save** button.
