## Fonts.com

[Fonts.com](http://fonts.com/) requires you to request fonts by "Project ID". Begin by creating a Web Font Project containing the fonts you want to use. When finished, head over to the Manage Web Fonts page (by selecting "Manage Web Fonts" from your user drop-down). Click the project title in the Projects table, then click the Publish Options link contained inside. A window will appear containing a line of JavaScript, as shown below. The Project ID is the bit of code between "jsapi/" and ".js" (`a6d406cc-1225-4d7e-894a-602898029eb1`). When finished click the **Save** button.
