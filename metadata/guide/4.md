Title: Fontdeck

## Fontdeck

The first step with [Fontdeck](http://fontdeck.com/) is to add a website to your account, then add the fonts you want to embed to that site. When you're ready to test things out, click on "Your account" at the top of Fontdeck.com, then click on the website you are using in the "Websites" table. At the top of the next page will be a "Project ID" displayed underneath your website's domain, as shown below. Copy/paste that number into the "Fontdeck" field in the Font Loader plugin's settings. When finished click the **Save** button.
