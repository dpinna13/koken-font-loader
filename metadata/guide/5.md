Title: Google

## Google

Unlike the others, the free [Google Web Fonts](http://google.com/webfonts) service doesn't require you to setup accounts, projects or websites. All you have to do is enter the names of the fonts you want to use, separated by commas. The screenshot below shows where to find font's name at their site.

Once you've found the names, enter them into the "Google" field in the plugin's settings, as demonstrated below.

When requesting a font by name Google returns whichever weight(s) are default (typically "Normal" / "400"). If you need to load additional weights or italicized versions you may append that information to the font's name inside a set of parenthesis. For example, in the "Quick use" view of a font you'll see an "Add this code to your website" box (shown below). Check boxes above for additional weights and the URL in this box will update. Copy the information that appears after the font's name, as highlighted below.

Next, assign that string to the font name inside the Font Loader settings, like so:

Some Google fonts include additional character sets besides Latin. These additional sets may be included by appending their set names to the parenthesis we added earlier. To find these names, check the character sets you want in the second step of the "Quick use" view we used above and append the `&subset=` string onto the end of the parenthesis. For example, here we load both the basic Latin and Latin Extended character sets:

If additional styles are not being requested you still need to include the ampersand. Here's an example where the regular 400 weight of Source Sans Pro is loaded with both the Latin and Latin Extended character sets:
